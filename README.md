This is a twitter based review webapp based in python that implements tweepy and flask. It will take a search phrase (A hashtag you want to know the positivity of) and review the last 100 tweets containing it to determine the ratio of positive to negative tweets.

Currently, it is on a stopped AWS EC2 instance due to pricing issues so the next step is to find a suitable host so it is publicaly available to use.
