This is a twitter based review webapp based in python that implements tweepy and flask. It will take a search phrase (A hashtag you want to know the positivity of) and review the last 100 tweets containing it to determine the ratio of positive to negative tweets.

Currently, it is running on a AWS EC2 instance and you can see it for yourself at ec2-3-133-143-226.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
